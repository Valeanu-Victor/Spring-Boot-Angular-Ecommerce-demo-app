# Spring-Boot-Angular-Ecommerce-demo-app
  This demo e-commerce web app is a work-in-progress personal project. Frontend is Angular 7, Backend is Spring Boot and for the database I have implemented h2 for now.

***Open cmd in UI folder and type command: "ng serve" , than open browser and go on "http://localhost:4200"***<br>
***Open secured-app with your IDE and run main class (SecuredAppApplication)***

***To be fixed:***
  The project still needs approved/unapproved messages/warnings to be added when the user registers/sells/buys an item.
  QuantityOrder being added in the ngFor in the products html component makes it that the input in a specific field is propagated in all the fields.
